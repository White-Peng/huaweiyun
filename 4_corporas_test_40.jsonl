Habermas argued that the dominant cultural model in 17th century France was a `` representational '' culture , which was based on a one - sided need to `` represent '' power with one side active and the other passive . A perfect example would be the Palace of Versailles , which was meant to overwhelm the senses of the visitor and convince one of the greatness of the French state and Louis XIV . Starting in the early 18th century the `` public sphere '' was `` critical '' in that both sides were active . Examples of the public sphere included newspapers , journals , masonic lodges , coffee houses and reading clubs where people either in person or virtually via the printed word debated and discussed issues . In France , the emergence of the public sphere outside of the control of the state led to the shift from Versailles to Paris as the cultural capital of France . Likewise , while in the 17th century the court had decided what was culturally good and what was not , in the 18th century the opinion of the court mattered less and consumers became the arbiters of cultural taste . In the 1750s , during the `` Querelle des Bouffons '' over the question of the quality of Italian vs. French music , the partisans of both sides appealed to the French public `` because it alone has the right to decide whether a work will be preserved for posterity or will be used by grocers as wrapping - paper '' . In 1782 , Louis - S\u00e9bastien Mercier wrote : `` The word court no longer inspires awe amongst us as in the time of Louis XIV . Reigning opinions are no longer received from the court ; it no longer decides on reputations of any sort ... The court 's judgments are countermanded ; one says openly that it understands nothing ; it has no ideas on the subject and could have none . '' Inevitably , the belief that public opinion had the right to decide cultural questions instead of deferring to the court transformed itself into the demand that the public also have a say on political questions as well .","title":"French Revolution"}

French forces were rebuilt , and feeling bitter about having lost many of France 's overseas colonies to the British Empire during the Seven Years ' War , Louis XVI was eager to give the American rebels financial and military support . After the British surrender at the Battle of Saratoga , the French sent 10,000 troops and millions of dollars to the rebels . Despite succeeding in gaining independence for the Thirteen Colonies , France was severely indebted by the American Revolutionary War .

Meanwhile , the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis . While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch , in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition . While he did reduce government expenditures , opponents in the parlements successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms .

Even completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned, for example, or reduced by unforeseen costs. Future cashflows are based on (amongst other things) how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time. Exercise for the reader: how many iPhone 22s will apple sell in 2029? Even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them; customers may not pay for goods, a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc.. Estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future. Investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument (this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year US treasury bond) that is guaranteed to give them a return. To invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that. The risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate. Calculation of that premium is highly subjective; if I know the management of the company well I will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky (or perhaps riskier...) than someone who does not, for example. Since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no \"\"right\"\" share price at any time, let alone at time of IPO. Each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading, based on their ever changing estimates, will move the share price to an indeterminable level. In comments to @keshlam's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before IPO.","title":""}

Dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a surrogate for market price but it will not and cannot accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation.\"","title":""}

Since you are not charging interest, it might seem more intuitive to create an \"\"Assets:Cash Loan\"\" account, and transfer money to & from it (when you receive payments) like you would with a bank account. Personally, I prefer to think of all loans as liabilities.  Whether it's a debt which you owe someone, or a balance which someone else owes you, since it's an 'unsettled' amount I file it under \"\"Liabilities:Loan\"\".  Either way, you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank, and then record payments as credits back to your primary account. The only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest (income) or if you forgave some or all of the loan (expense) at some point in the future.\"","title":""}

Throughout the year, different parts of Earth receive the Sun's most direct rays. So, when the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere. And when the South Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\t\n\nIt's all about Earth's tilt!\nMany people believe that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer and that is why it is hotter. And, likewise, they think Earth is farthest from the Sun in the winter.\nAlthough this idea makes sense, it is incorrect.\nIt is true that Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle. It is a bit lop-sided. During part of the year, Earth is closer to the Sun than at other times. However, in the Northern Hemisphere, we are having winter when Earth is closest to the Sun and summer when it is farthest away! Compared with how far away the Sun is, this change in Earth's distance throughout the year does not make much difference to our weather.\nThere is a different reason for Earth's seasons.\nEarth's axis is an imaginary pole going right through the center of Earth from \"top\" to \"bottom.\" Earth spins around this pole, making one complete turn each day. That is why we have day and night, and why every part of Earth's surface gets some of each.\nEarth has seasons because its axis doesn't stand up straight. \nBut what caused Earth to tilt?\n\nLong, long ago, when Earth was young, it is thought that something big hit Earth and knocked it off-kilter. So instead of rotating with its axis straight up and down, it leans over a bit.\nBy the way, that big thing that hit Earth is called Theia. It also blasted a big hole in the surface.","title":"What Causes the Seasons? | NASA Space Place \u2013 NASA Science for Kids"}
